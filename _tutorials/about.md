My name is Rooholla Khorrambakht, and I’m a [K.N.Toosi](https://en.kntu.ac.ir) master’s student in the field of mechatronics engineering. I have a passion for AI, robotics, embedded systems, and sensor fusion. I joined the [ARAS research group](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/) in October 2016. Currently, I have the privilege of doing research toward developing fusion and AI algorithms for perception and localization of robotic systems. I also find the real-time implementation of the algorithms to be of pivotal importance in constructing real-world robotic systems. Thus, alongside investigating the theories behind the algorithms and the optimization strategies, I also consider new technologies such as hardware accelerators, heterogeneous embedded SOCs, and microcontrollers for implementing the various levels of robotic and perception systems.
